# Long Term Support Schedule
This schedule is meant to set expectations around support of legacy versions of this library.  Ongoing support of 
older versions is meant to help support security concerns without the need to migrate, while allowing time to migrate
to newer versions of the library. Deprecated major versions of the library will be supported for 6 months after the 
publish of a new major version.
